## Known Issues

Currently in Closed Beta, we are working on patching the following issues:

- **GitLab project:** Currently in Beta, GitLab projects are not yet supported. Only GitHub projects are supported.
- **Branch name:** Currently in Beta, only branches named ‘Main’ can generate a build.
- **Hardcoded build environment variables:** In the Build Details view, the build environment variables listed are not your own, they are hardcoded. We will be removing the hardcoding soon.
- **Deleted API Keys listed:** In build configurations, you may see deleted API Keys still appear in the list of selectable API Keys.
- **Disconnect Repository when deleting a Worker:** It is advised to first disconnect the associated git repository in 'Settings > Build' before deleting the Worker to avoid complications when reusing that repository in the future.

If you discover additional issues, please notify us in the Closed Beta Discord channel.
