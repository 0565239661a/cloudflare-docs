You may tell Workers Builds how your application needs to be built and deployed.

## Build Settings

You can configure Cloudflare to automatically build and deploy your Worker when a pull request is merged into a specific branch of your Git repository.

Build settings can be found on the Settings page of your Worker. The following options are available:

- **Git account**
  - Set the git account you would like to choose your repository from.
- **Git repository**
  - Select the git repository you would like to connect to your Worker.
- **Git branch**
  - Select the branch you would like Cloudflare to listen to for new commits. This will be defaulted to main.
- **Build command** (Optional)
  - Add a build command if your project requires a build step for example if you are building with assets. Reference supported frameworks for correct build command.
- **Deploy command**
  - The deploy command lets you choose the specific Wrangler command you would like to use to deploy your Worker. Your deploy command is defaulted to `npx Wrangler deploy`, but it can be customized as needed. You can also upload as a version, and take advantage of gradual deployments here.
- **Root Directory** (Optional)
  - Specify the root directory of your Worker. The root directory describes where the build command will run.
- **API Key** (Optional)
  - By default, Cloudflare will generate an API token for your account or you can create and select an existing API token from a previous build in the API token drop down. These API tokens will be created with the following permissions for your account:
    - **Account:** Account Settings (read), Workers Scripts (edit), Workers KV Storage (edit), Workers R2 Storage (edit)
    - **Zone:** Workers Routes (edit) for all zones on the account
    - **User:** User Details (read), Memberships (read)
- **Build variable** (Optional)
  - Add variables and secrets accessible only to your build.

## Monorepo support

You can choose to use a monorepo (a Git repository that contains multiple project) with Workers. To do so, you must:

1. Connect your monorepo git repository to each of your associated Workers
2. Set up your build configuration to only deploy to that specific Worker by setting the correct root directory in your build configuration.

Note that when a new commit is detected in the monorepo, all the associated Workers will trigger a new build and deploy.

## Wrangler Environment support

To set up Workers with [Wrangler Enviornments](/workers/wrangler/environments/):

1. (Optional) Deploy via Wrangler to create the Worker for your environments in the Dashboard, if you donâ€™t already have them.
2. Find the Workers for your environments. They are typically named `[name of Worker] - [environment name]`.
3. Connect your repository to each of the Worker for your environment.
4. Git push to your repository. All your associated Workers will trigger a new build.
