If your organization has interest in becoming a provider or a subscriber, contact your account team to facilitate the required authorization.

## Create a Custom Indicator Feed

Providers can create and manage a Custom Indicator Feed with the [Indicator API endpoints](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-get-indicator-feeds):

1. Create a feed with the [Create new indicator feed endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-create-indicator-feeds). Feeds are lists of indicators.
2. Upload data to the feed with the [Update indicator feed data endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-update-indicator-feed-data). Uploaded indicator data must be in a [`.stix2`](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) formatted file.

   :::note
   Indicator feeds use a snapshot system. To update feeds with new data, providers must upload a file containing all previous and new indicators.
   :::

3. Grant access to subscribers with the [Grant permission to indicator feed endpoint](/api/operations/custom-indicator-feeds-add-permission). Any administrator of the account that owns the feed must add subscribers' `account_tag`s to the feed's allowed subscribers list.

## Use a feed in Gateway

Once an account is granted access to a feed, it will be available to match traffic as a [selector in Gateway DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#indicator-feeds).

1. In [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), go to **Gateway** > **Firewall Policies**. Select **DNS**.
2. To create a new DNS policy, select **Add a policy**.
3. Name your policy.
4. In **Traffic**, add a condition with the **Indicator Feeds** selector. If your account has been granted access to a Custom Indicator Feed, Gateway will list the feed in **Value**. For example, you can block sites that appear in a feed:

   | Selector        | Operator | Value               | Action |
   | --------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------ |
   | Indicator Feeds | in       | _Threat Intel Feed_ | Block  |

5. Select **Create policy**.

For more information on creating Gateway policies, refer to [DNS policies](/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/).
