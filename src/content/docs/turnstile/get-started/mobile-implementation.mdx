Turnstile is designed to run in a standard browser environment, which includes mobile devices.

Any modifications to the environment, such as the User Agent, [Content Security Policy settings](/turnstile/reference/content-security-policy/), or domain allowlisting, can disrupt the successful completion of Turnstile challenges. To ensure compatibility, it is recommended to start with a default, unmodified environment and gradually introduce changes, validating Turnstile’s functionality after each adjustment.

On native mobile applications, Turnstile can be used with WebViews. This applies to native web applications for iOS and Android. When implementing Turnstile for mobile, ensure you address the common issues below to avoid integration problems.

## WebView configurations

Turnstile requires specific WebView settings to function properly. You must include the following lines in your code to enable necessary features:

```javascript
webView.settings.domStorageEnabled = true;
```

```javascript
webView.settings.javaScriptEnabled = true;
```

These settings ensure that the mobile WebView can properly load and execute the Turnstile challenge. If these configurations are missing, Turnstile may malfunction.

For Android implementations, refer to [`setJavaScriptEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setJavaScriptEnabled(boolean)) to tell the WebView to enable JavaScript execution and [`setDomStorageEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setDomStorageEnabled(boolean)) to enable the DOM storage API.

## Update allowed origins

In addition to ensuring proper WebView settings, it is essential to update the allowed origins list to include `challenges.cloudflare.com`.

Without this, Turnstile challenges might fail to load. WebView should also be configured to allow insecure connections (`http` and `https`). 

## Maintain a consistent user agent

When implementing Turnstile with WebViews, the user agent must stay consistent as changing the user agent will cause the challenges to fail. 

## Use Pre-Clearance cookies

When using [Pre-Clearance cookies](/turnstile/concepts/pre-clearance-support/) with Turnstile, make sure that it is executed in the same environment where the challenges will occur, including the same browser or device configuration. If Pre-Clearance is done in a different environment, the Pre-Clearance cookie may become invalid and lead to failed challenges.

## Use Flutter with Turnstile

For developers using Flutter, Turnstile is compatible and tested with Flutter’s WebView implementation. Refer to the official Flutter WebView package for more details and usage.
